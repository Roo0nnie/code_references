		      Abstract Queue										FIFO PRINCIPLE OF QUEUE:

	An Abstract Queue (Queue ADT) is an abstract					* A Queue is like a line waiting to purchase tickets, where the first 
     data type that emphasizes specific operations:					person in line is the first person served. (i.e. First come first serve).

	* There are no restrictions on objects inserted into				similarly, the position of the last entry in the queue, that is, the one most

	* The remove operation (popping from the queue)
	removes the current front of the queue						* Queue can handle multiple data.			
											* We can access both ends.
											* They are fast and flexible. 
	A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open 
     at both ends and the operations are performed in First In First							
     Out (FIFO) order.												QUEUE REPRESENTATION
